# ‚ú® CRYPTOSENT: Airline Sentiment & Emotion Analysis Project

This project, titled **CRYPTOSENT**, is a complete sentiment analysis and emotion detection pipeline built using Python. It processes and classifies airline-related text data to identify **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments and detect associated **emotions** using the NRC Emotion Lexicon.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: The main script in this repository uses file paths hardcoded for the creator‚Äôs local device. Therefore, this project is intended **for viewing and educational purposes only**. You must adapt the paths manually if you wish to reuse or run the project on your system.

## üß† Features

- Extracts and processes text data from a zipped CSV dataset.
- Preprocesses text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Converts cleaned text into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier to detect sentiment polarity.
- Uses the **NRC Emotion Lexicon** to analyze and plot emotional expressions.
- Displays performance metrics: **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** using a `classification_report`.
- Visualizations included:
  - Donut chart for sentiment distribution
  - Word count comparison (raw vs cleaned)
  - Emotion distribution bar chart
  - Heatmap for the confusion matrix

## üìä Performance Metrics

The model evaluates sentiment predictions using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

All are shown via `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`.

## üß™ How to Use (Advanced Users)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: You will need to manually change file paths in `main_project.py` to match your system's directory structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Portability Notice

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
2.Download the NRC Emotion Lexicon if not already included.
3.Run the script after adjusting file paths accordingly.

### ‚úÖ Recommended modification: Use `os.path.join()` and `__file__`

Instead of writing paths like this:
```python
data_path = "datasets/extracted dataset/dataset.csv"

Use this portable approach:
import os

# Get the absolute path to the current script
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Construct paths in a system-independent way
data_path = os.path.join(base_dir, "datasets", "extracted dataset", "dataset.csv")

This ensures the project works across different operating systems and folder structures.
